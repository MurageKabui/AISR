   <summary>A step-by-step breakdown</summary>
  
  
   1. **Device Initialization**: 
       - The app is launched, `deviceready` event is fired, it signifies the app is ready to interact with native plugins and features via cordova.
    
   2. **Registering the SMS Listener**:
       - After firing the `deviceready` event, if SMS watching is allowed, an event listener ``onSMSArrive`` from ``cordova-plugin-sms-receive`` is registered. This listener is responsible for detecting incoming SMS messages on the host device.
       
       > This is assuming that the Phone and SMS permission is allowed.
    
   3. **Capturing Incoming SMS**:
       - When a new SMS message is detected, `onSMSArrive` event is triggered.  We proceed to extract the SMS data, specifically the message body, sender's address and the current date.
    
   4. **AI-Powered Response Generation**:
       - The extracted SMS body along with the last nth messages are sent to Groqcloud AI API for analysis in order to generate a contextually accurate reply.
       
       > A system prompt can be set-up to allow a personalized processing for the message.
    
   5. **User Interaction**:
       - After the AI generates a reply, the app prompts the user to review and approve the response. An adjustable timer is initiated, giving the user a specified amount of time to approve or modify the reply.
    
   6. **Automated Reply**:
       - If the user approves the AI-generated reply within the given time, the reply is sent back to the original sender.
       
       If the timer expires without user intervention, the app can either send the reply automatically or cancel the operation based on predefined settings.
